# BCG-BUSINESS-PROJECT
this project addresses a client PowerCo - a major gas and electricity utility concerned about losing customers.
Here are the key takeaways from the client:

PowerCo - a major gas and electricity utility that supplies small and medium-sized enterprises.
The energy market has had a lot of change in recent years and there are more options than ever for customers to choose from.
PowerCo is concerned about its customers leaving for better offers from other energy providers. 
This is becoming a big issue for PowerCo and they need help in diagnosing the reason why their customers are churning.
One potential reason for this churn is how “sensitive” the price is. In other words, how much is price a factor in a customer’s choice to stay with or leave PowerCo?
